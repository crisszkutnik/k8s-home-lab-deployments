## 📖 Overview

This is the repository for my on-premise Kubernetes cluster that runs in my house. It uses GitOps techniques in order to keep the content of this repository in-sync with the cluster. Basic stuff is:

- [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) for GitOps and keeping the cluster in sync with the repo Also
- [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) to update dependencies
- [Trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for credential scanning and avoid leaking private credentials

In case you want to check the full index of my on-premise stuff, check [crisszkutnik/kubernetes-home-lab](https://github.com/crisszkutnik/kubernetes-home-lab)

## 💻 Setup, deployments and details

The cluster runs a variety of applications for setup and management such as:

- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for charts and observability
- [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) and [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/send-data/promtail/) for log collection
- [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) as load balancer via L2 advertisement
- [NGINX ingress controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/) is used as an ingress controller
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus-operator.dev/) for metrics and monitoring
- [1Password operator](https://developer.1password.com/docs/k8s/k8s-integrations/) for secret management and automatic redeployment on secret update

It also runs a bunch of other applications that were developed for personal use
